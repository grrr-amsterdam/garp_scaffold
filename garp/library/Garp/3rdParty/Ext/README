Greetings fellow nerd!

The namespace Garp_3rdParty_Ext_ contains classes that are custom extentions on 3rd party libraries.
Please follow this convention...

Garp_3rdParty_Ext_<libraryName>_<etc>_<etc>

...where <libraryName> is the name of the 3rd party library.

This namespace exists so that 3rd party libraries can be updated without messing up Garp-specific custom extentions.


As you were.
