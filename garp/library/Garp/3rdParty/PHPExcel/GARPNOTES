This package is updated by Harmen Janssen on August 8, 2012.
Most file_exists() and related calls are commented out.

These calls were problematic because our import files resolve to URLs, and
file_exists doesn't work with URLs.

So even though there was no problem reading the file, checking wether it could
be read resulted in an exception.
