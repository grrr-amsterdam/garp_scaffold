 * Garp_Model_Helper_Core

 * notified either first or last, and are part of 
 * Garp's core functionality.
 * This means you don't have to register them manually as observers.
 * 
 * An example is Cachable; this is standard core functionality
 * of Garp and it's not the developer's responsibility to register
 * it â€” it will be registered automatically.
